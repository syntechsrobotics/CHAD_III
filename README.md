# CHAD_III

This is where the team 6408V keeps their code (this is my code . i am writing this. i do not know why this is in third person). 

the code is used for the vex robotics tower takeover competition. 


please try not to steal our code, because it is bad and does not work well. 

if you do want to steal code, steal the fish. just put a little fish on your robot. its cool.

thats it
